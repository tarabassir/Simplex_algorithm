The Simplex Algorithm is a method which seeks the optimal solution for an initial equation based on two or more constraints.  The purpose of this project is to develop a user-friendly program that implements this algorithm. 
The code is divided between two python scripts.  The script main.py handles the input, creates the simplex tableau of variable size with appropriate elements filled in, and then instantiates an object specifically developed for manipulating the simplex tableau until an optimal solution has been found.  The class method calculate_optimal_solution() that is invoked in main.py and is implemented in the script simplex_algorithm.py, calls various internal class methods that determines if an optimal solution has been found, and if not, performs the necessary operations to do so.
